# FRC CommonLib Robot Template Project [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Team488/TeamXbot2018.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Team488/TeamXbot2018)

This is a template project which includes all the boilerplate to use our Seriously Common Lib. It can be forked and used as a robot project for the season if you want to use our library.

To find out more about the library, visit the [Seriously Common Lib repo](https://github.com/Team488/SeriouslyCommonLib).

## Up-front warning

This template, like our library as a whole, is a work-in-progress. See the library readme for more information.
